This is a game developed for mobile, browser and desktop.

Check the [releases](https://github.com/luanorlandi/Hex/releases) tab and the [html host](https://luanorlandi.github.io/Hex/) here to play it.

## More than just a game

Hex is also part of a scientific research project.

The game was the developed (and being updated from time to time) applying math and basic programming concepts in computer science.

The project Math and programming in Hex had the objective of study and apply analytical geometry (and math, in general), Game Theory and artificial intelligence concepts on game development.

It's a different way to learn those field of study. You can check this [wiki page](https://github.com/luanorlandi/Hex/wiki) to see for yourself and learn math and programming in a more interesting manner.

There is also a portuguese pdf made at the end of the scientific research project, check it out [here](https://github.com/luanorlandi/Hex/blob/master/wiki/Matem%C3%A1tica%20e%20programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20em%20Hex.pdf).
